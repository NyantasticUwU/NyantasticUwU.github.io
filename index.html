                        Hi! I'm Nyantastic, and I started programming as a hobby in late March (2020). Covid-19 forced me into staying inside with 
                        nothing to do, so I decided to start taking coding semi-seriously. My first language that I decided to write in was Python 
                        (obviously). Before this, I wrote small and simple scripts, so actually taking things seriously wasn't much of a challenge for me. 
                        But later I decided that Python was too simple and easy for me. I wanted a challenge. So, after some research on various 
                        different programming languages, I decided that C++ was best for me. Though I now have knowledge of some of the top most 
                        wanted programming languages, due to the efforts that went into studying them.
