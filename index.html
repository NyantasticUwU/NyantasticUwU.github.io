                        Hi! I'm Nyantastic (duh), and I started programming as a hobby in late March (2020). Covid-19 forced me into staying inside 
                        with nothing to do, so I decided to start taking coding semi-seriously. My first language that I decided to write in was python 
                        (obviously). Before this, I wrote small and simple scripts, so actually taking things seriously wasn't much of a challenge for me. 
                        But later I decided that python was too simple and easy for me. I wanted a challenge. So, after some research on various 
                        different programming languages, I decided that C++ was best for me. Though I now have knowledge of some of the top most 
                        wanted programming languages, due to the efforts that went into studying them.

                        Most of the projects that I work on are either private or owned by somebody else. All of the public projects that I own can be 
                        found on <a href="https://github.com/NyantasticUwU" target="_blank">my github</a>. As of the time of writing this, there aren't many public projects. Though I do plan on making most of my 
                        future projects public for anyone to view, at any given time.
